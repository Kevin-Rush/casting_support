## Installation

To install the dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt` file using pip, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where your `requirements.txt` file is located. In this case, it would be `/c:/Users/kevin/Documents/Coding/casting_support/`.
3. Run the following command to install the requirements:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This command will read the `requirements.txt` file and install all the listed dependencies.

4. Wait for the installation process to complete. Once finished, you will have all the necessary dependencies installed and ready to use.

Make sure you have pip installed on your system before running the above command. If you don't have pip installed, you can follow the official pip installation guide for your operating system.
